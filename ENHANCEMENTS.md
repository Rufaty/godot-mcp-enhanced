## üéâ Major Update: Enhanced AI Capabilities & Kiro IDE Support

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Version**: 1.1.0

---

## ‚ú® What's New

### 1. üß† Comprehensive AI Instructions

Added `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - a complete guide for AI assistants that includes:

- **Core Principles** for effective game development assistance
- **Tool Usage Patterns** with step-by-step workflows
- **Game Development Workflows** for common tasks:
  - Creating platformer players
  - Building main menus
  - Implementing enemy AI
- **Advanced Reasoning Patterns** for complex problem-solving
- **Checklists** for common game development tasks
- **Best Practices** for AI-assisted development

**Why This Matters**: AI assistants now have comprehensive guidance on how to use the tools effectively, leading to better results and fewer errors.

### 2. üé® Kiro IDE Support

Added complete Kiro IDE integration with `docs/KIRO_SETUP.md`:

- **Step-by-step setup guide** for Kiro users
- **Kiro-specific features** and workflows
- **Pro tips** for maximizing productivity
- **Configuration examples** with proper paths
- **Troubleshooting** for common Kiro issues
- **Performance optimization** tips

**Why This Matters**: Kiro IDE users now have first-class support with dedicated documentation and examples.

### 3. üöÄ Godot Process Management

Added 3 new tools for managing Godot:

#### `check_godot_running`
- Check if Godot editor is running and responsive
- No parameters needed
- Returns running status and responsiveness

#### `launch_godot`
- Launch Godot editor with a specific project
- Can launch in editor mode or run mode
- Automatically detects Godot executable from environment
- Parameters:
  - `project_path`: Path to project directory
  - `editor_mode`: true for editor, false to run project

#### `get_godot_version`
- Get the version of configured Godot executable
- Useful for compatibility checking
- Returns version string and executable path

**Why This Matters**: AI can now detect if Godot is running and launch it automatically if needed. No more "connection refused" errors!

### 4. üìÅ Direct File System Tools

Added 8 new tools that work **without Godot running**:

#### Scene File Operations
- `read_scene_file`: Read .tscn files directly
- `write_scene_file`: Write .tscn files directly

#### Script File Operations
- `read_script_file`: Read .gd files directly
- `write_script_file`: Write .gd files directly

#### Project Settings
- `read_project_settings`: Read project.godot file
- `update_project_settings`: Modify project settings

#### Directory Operations
- `create_directory`: Create folders in project
- `list_directory`: List directory contents (with recursive option)

**Why This Matters**: AI can now work with your project even when Godot isn't running. Create scripts, modify scenes, and manage files directly!

## üéØ Use Cases Enabled

### 1. Autonomous Game Development

AI can now build complete games from scratch:

```
@godot Check if Godot is running. If not, launch it with my project.
Then create a complete platformer game with:
- Player character with movement and jump
- Enemy AI with patrol and chase
- Collectible coins
- Main menu and HUD
- Win/lose conditions
```

### 2. Offline Development

Work on your project without Godot running:

```
@godot Create a new enemy script at res://scripts/enemies/goblin.gd
with AI behavior, health system, and attack patterns.
(Works even if Godot is closed!)
```

### 3. Project Setup Automation

Automate project configuration:

```
@godot Update my project settings to:
- Set game name to "My Awesome Game"
- Set window size to 1920x1080
- Enable vsync
- Configure input mappings
```

### 4. Batch File Operations

Process multiple files efficiently:

```
@godot List all script files in my project, then:
- Read each one
- Add proper type hints
- Add documentation comments
- Save the updated versions
```

## üí° Tips for Using New Features

### Tip 1: Always Check Godot Status

Start your workflow by checking if Godot is running:

```
@godot check_godot_running
```

If not running, launch it:

```
@godot launch_godot project_path="path/to/your/project"
```

### Tip 2: Use File System Tools for Batch Operations

When creating multiple files, use direct file system tools:

```
@godot write_script_file path="res://scripts/player.gd" content="..."
@godot write_script_file path="res://scripts/enemy.gd" content="..."
@godot write_script_file path="res://scripts/coin.gd" content="..."
```

### Tip 3: Leverage AI Instructions

AI assistants can now follow complex workflows automatically. Just describe what you want:

```
Create a complete 2D platformer game following the workflow in AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md
```

### Tip 4: Combine Tools Creatively

Mix Godot-dependent and file system tools:

```
1. @godot check_godot_running
2. If not running, create scripts with write_script_file
3. When Godot starts, use add_node to build scenes
4. Use get_editor_screenshot to verify
```
