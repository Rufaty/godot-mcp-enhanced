## üí° Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific
‚ùå "Make a player"
‚úÖ "Create a CharacterBody2D player with sprite, collision, and camera"

### Request Verification
Always ask to see results:
- "Show me a screenshot"
- "Show me the scene tree"
- "Verify the code works"

### Iterate Incrementally
Build step-by-step:
1. Create basic structure
2. Add functionality
3. Test
4. Refine

### Use Context
Start with:
```
@godot get windsurf context
```

Then make informed changes based on your current project state.
